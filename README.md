# minimalist
a pure and simple CSS framework that does not try to cover every use case.

> The bulk of this comes from the [work we had done](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-minimalist) on this as part of the MDN Web Docs project. We want to ackowledge that and are thankful for the contributions by everyone there.
